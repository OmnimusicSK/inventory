## Quick Start Guide

The Korg X5-D is a 61-key polyphonic digital synthesiser. It's a general purpose keyboard for creating all kinds of sounds.

Connect the DC power jack, and plug a speaker into the "L/MONO" jack on the rear. Ensure the "MASTER VOLUME" fader on the left side of the keyboard is turned up. You can now play the keys and hear sound. You can change presets with the up/yes and down/no buttons.

You can also trigger the keyboard using a classic MIDI (5 pin din) connection.

See the manual for more details:

## Troubleshooting

If MIDI does not seem to trigger the keyboard, try checking that the keyboard is in "global" receive mode, by pressing the "global" button.
