## Quick Start Guide

Plug in the CMPSR, using the included USB-C cable. It should start up and show up as a MIDI input in your operating system. 
You can then use it to make musical notes in any DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), such as garageBand, thumbJam, ableton live, logic, etc.

## Troubleshooting

-BLE (bluetooth) MIDI is initialised by pressing the small button underneath the controller. Always try connecting BLE within your music software first. For example, in Thumbjam, go to Prefs -> MIDI Control -> Scan for Bluetooth LE.

[Pairing is completed in the Bluetooth manager on MAC, or within your music software](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/audio-midi-setup/ams33f013765/mac)

On Windows, third party pieces of software need to be installed - See our full guide to using BLE devices on windows (it's surprisingly difficult) [here](https://omnimusicsk.github.io/inventory/Guides/Windows%20BLE/Windows%20BLE.html)

On Android, pairing is likely completed within your music software.

-Power on/off by holding the button on the underside.

-Reset by holding the two top buttons for a few seconds.
