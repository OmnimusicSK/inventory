## Quick Start Guide

MusiKraken is a general purpose app that can use various sensors on your android/iOs device to build MIDI interfaces. The free version allows simple inputs like buttons and keyboards, the paid version (£8.99 Android/£9.99 iPad) allows for head/face tracking and many (many) more.

The default onscreen keyboard is tied into a simple synthesiser. You can edit the interface by pressing the arrow in the top right. You can then add modules by clicking on the "+" icon.

MusiKraken uses a modular interface that can take some getting used to - we recommend a session of experimenting with it until you are confident. In general though, you have "inputs" - these could be onscreen keyboards and pads, sensors or face tracking; and "outputs" like a built in synthesiser, or even bluetooth and network MIDI.
