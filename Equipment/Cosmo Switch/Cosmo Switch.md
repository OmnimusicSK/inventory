## Quick Start Guide

The Cosmo switch is a battery-powered bluetooth accessibility switch. It is touch and proximity sensitive, and also has configurable lighting built in. It can be mounted on a music stand if required.

Configuration of the cosmo switch is handled through the Cosmo app:

[App store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/cosmo-switch-setup/id1579690343)
[Google Play - currently not available](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.filisia.cosmoswitchsetup)

After downloading the app, you can follow on-screen instructions to configure the switch.

It can be then paired with a device, and it'll act as a bluetooth keyboard. When you press/interact with a switch, it'll trigger a keypress on the configured key (i.e. space bar). This is useful in various pieces of software.
