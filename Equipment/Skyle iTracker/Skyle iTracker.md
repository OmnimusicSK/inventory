## Quick Start Guide

The iTracker is most suitable for users that mainly have control over their eye movements, and perhaps some other parts of their body. We'll mainly be using it to control [thumbJam](<https://omnimusicsk.github.io/inventory/Equipment/Thumb%20Jam/Thumb%20Jam.html>).

This is a complicated piece of kit, so we recommend you practice using it yourself before introducing it to someone else.


Ensure the iPad is charged (as much as possible). You can mount the iPad using the included stand, which can be clamped to a table or other suitable point - it's very flexible.

For whatever reason, you can't switch on the iPad while it's charging, or the iTracker will not start correctly - so just make sure it's not charging when you switch it on. This can be done with the single button on the side/top.

Open the Skyle app (it looks like a colourful digital iris). It should connect to the eyeTracker bar at this point, and you'll see a camera feed appear. You can adjust the user's position and calibrate the eyegaze system now.

The user will ideally be positioned a couple of feet from the iPad. You should be able to see both pupils in the onscreen viewer. The coloured bars at the top and side of the screen will show the ideal positioning.

![Calibration Screen Example Image](<https://www.spectronics.com.au/images/product/inclusivet/Calibration-Skyle.png>)
There are two calibration options - a quick calibration and a full calibration (for most precise results). Each calibration involves staring at the centre of some pulsating circles in different areas of the screen.

After calibration, you will now have control over a hovering circle. You can hold the circle in place for a few seconds to "click".

You can navigate to the home screen, and change the click behaviour using the menu on the right side of the screen (a transparent square showing a circle with a point in the middle).

The external switch can be attached to the underside of the iTracker, and can be used to "click" the onscreen mouse instead.

## Troubleshooting

For whatever reason, you can't switch on the iPad while it's charging, or the iTracker will not start correctly - so just make sure it's not charging when you switch it on. If this is the case for you, you can restart the ipad by holding down the top button and the volume up button at the same time. A slider will appear on screen and you can drag it to the left to shut down the iPad. Once shut down, you can turn it on again by holding the top button.
