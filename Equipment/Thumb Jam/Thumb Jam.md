## Quick Start Guide

Thumb Jam should be installed on all Omnimusic iPads. Tap on the thumbJam icon (a fingerprint) to open it.

Hit the "Sound" button in the top left corner, then "Change Instrument" to alter the instrument sound. You can also alter the scale by tapping "Change Scale".

You can also use the "Oct" and "Span" + and - buttons, which let you adjust the playable range by octaves and the number of notes on screen.

There are extensive instructions on all of thumbJam's features here:

Drake music Scotland has an excellent intro video here:

They also have a good guide for locking areas of the screen using the iPad's built in "guided access" settings (section 3):
